<h3 class="sub-header">The Great Wall of China</h3>
<img src="imgs/gwoc.jpg" alt="Great Wall of China">
<div class="container">The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, built during the Qin Dynasty as a means of protection against the Huns. Dubbed the Great Wall of China because of its marvel length; it spans more than 13,000 miles! The Great Wall served to prevent invasions although it never particularly worked well. The Great Wall as it is known today was mainly constructed during the Ming Dynasty circa 1368-1644. The wall itself was not always "great." Initially, states constructed walls to protect their states, which later became part of the <span class="span">Chu State Wall</span>. Under the rule of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, soldiers and convicts were ordered to construct this wall. It is said that more than 400,000 people died building this wall; most of whom were buried in the wall.

<div class="container">Petra is an ancient city that lies in present-day Jordan and dates back to the fourth century B.C. Not only is Petra an archeological fascination because of its rock-cut architecture, but also because of its early implementation of a plumbing system. Petra has also been referred to as the "Rose city" because of the unique color of the stones used in the buildings. The city of Petra was established as a trading post and the <span class="span">Nabateans</span> -an Arab Bedouin tribe- accumulated a significant amount of wealth. Envious of their riches, the Greek empire attacked the city in 312 B.C.

<h3 class="sub-header">The Colosseum</h3>
<img src="imgs/colosseum.jpg" alt="Colosseum">
<div class="container">The Colosseum is a massive stone structure commissioned by <span class="span">Emperor Vespasian</span> of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. The Colosseum is a collosal ampitheatre intended for entertainment purposes. Also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, the Colosseum was home to events such as gladitorial fights and wild animal fights. After 4 centuries of active use, the arena was neglected and up until the 18th century, the Colosseum was used as a source of building materials. Hence, the Colosseum is not in its original glory. However, the amphitheater remains a popular tourist site, as well as being an iconic symbol of the Roman empire.

<div class="container">Chichen Itza was a Mayan city located on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. As one of the seven World wonders, Chichen Itza is an important tourist attraction site.

The name Chichen Itza means "at the mouth of the well of Itza." The Itzans were an ethnic group of Mayans who rose to power in the northern part of the Yucatan Peninsula. The "well" in the name of Chichen Itza is referring to the numerous underground rivers beneath the region that served as a water source for the city.

    <div class="container">Machu Picchu is located in Peru on mountainous terrain. Tourists are welcomed with more than 3,000 stone steps carved into the terrace that link its many different levels.
