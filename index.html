<img src="imgs/gwoc.jpg" alt="Great Wall of China">
<div class="boxed">The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, built during the Qin Dynasty as a means of protection against the Huns. Dubbed the Great Wall of China because of its marvel length. It spans more than 13,000 miles! The Great Wall served to prevent invasions although it never particularly worked well. The Great Wall as it is known today was mainly constructed during the Ming Dynasty circa 1368-1644. The wall itself was not always "great." Initially, states constructed walls to protect their states, which later became part of the Chu State Wall. Under the rule of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, soldiers and convicts were ordered to construct this wall. It is said that more than 400,000 people died building this wall; most of whom were buried in the wall.
